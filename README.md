# WhatsApp-birthay-wisher
It's a Python script that will send an automatucally generated birthday wish to a whatsapp chat or group chat.
The script sends randomly one of the 12 generated messages to a selected chat id(preferrably group chat id). It also pulls the names and ages from excel file to insert it into congratilation letter.

Place both excel and python files in one folder.
Edit the Excel file and inster the names and date of birth of persons you wish. DD-MM-YY. Names are needed for the script to pull them from excel.
Go to Green-API weebsite and create an instance. Free trial lets you use only 3 instaces (3 group chats), including your owwn phone number. So it's recommended to buy additional instance.
Then using the Green-API find out the WhatsApp chat ID. This script is better for group chats. So recommended to find a group chat ID.
Then enter these inforations in the python script and launch it.
